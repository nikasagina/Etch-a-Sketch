# Etch a Sketch

Etch a Sketch is a simple drawing tool that allows users to draw on a grid of squares by hovering the mouse over them. The color of the squares changes to black as the mouse moves over them, creating a drawing. The tool also includes a "clear" button that allows users to erase the drawing and start again. Additionally, users can resize the grid by specifying the number of squares they want it to contain.

This project was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
